Large solitary trees are important structures in many landscapes. They host a large biodiversity and provide our society with numerous ecosystem services such as cooling, air filtering and cultural values. However, they are threathened by increased droughts, pests and pathogens and other disturbances.

Here, [an international team of researchers](https://fleur.ugent.be/) is investigating the value of large solitary trees and how this will be affected in the face of climate change.
