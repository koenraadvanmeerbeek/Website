Large solitary trees are important structures in many landscapes. They host a large biodiversity and provide our society with numerous ecosystem services such as cooling, air filtering and cultural values. However, they are threathened by increased droughts, pests and pathogens and other disturbances.

Within the CoolTree project, [an international team of researchers](https://fleur.ugent.be/) is investigating the ecological value of large solitary trees in 9 European regions and how this will be affected in the face of climate change. For this, we identify the plant, insect, fungi and microbe species that are associated with these large solitary trees. We also measure how the tree itself is affecting the soil and the climate in its environment.
