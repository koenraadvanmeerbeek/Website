Environmental temperatures are usually based on data aggregated on coarse 1 x 1 kmÂ² resolutions. However, we know that temperatures in an environment can vary dramatically over just a few metres, sometimes even more than over kilometres. While this heterogeneity in microclimate is beginning to be measured and explored, little is known about how heterogeneity relates to the distance between locations and other environmental drivers. In this project we use the [SoilTemp](https://soiltemp.weebly.com/) network of soil temperature sensors to quantify microclimate heterogeneity and study its drivers.
