abstract: "Spatiotemporal redistribution of incident rainfall in vegetated ecosystems results from the partitioning by plants into intercepted, stemflow, and throughfall fractions. However, variation in patterns and drivers of rainfall partitioning across global biomes remains poorly understood, which limited the ability of climate models to improve the predictions of biome hydrological cycle under global climate change scenario. Here, we synthesized and analyzed the partitioning of incident rainfall into interception, stemflow, and throughfall by trees and shrubs at the global scale using 2430 observations from 236 independent publications. We found that (1) globally, median levels of relative interception, stemflow, and throughfall accounted for 21.8%, 3.2%, and 73.0% of total incident rainfall, respectively; (2) rainfall partitioning varied among different biomes, due to variation in plant composition, canopy structure, and macroclimate; (3) relative stemflow tended to be driven by plant traits, such as crown height:width ratio, basal area, and height, while relative interception and throughfall tended to be driven by plant traits as well as meteorological variables. Our global assessment of patterns and drivers of rainfall partitioning underpins the role of meteorological factors and plant traits in biome-specific ecohydrological cycles. We suggest to include these factors in climate models to improve the predictions of local hydrological cycles and associated biodiversity and function responses to changing climate conditions."
