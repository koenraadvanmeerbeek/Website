Climate change has already contributed substantially to the current biodiversity crisis. To evaluate and predict the future effects of climate change on biodiversity loss, species distribution models (SDMs) are a commonly used technique. Macroclimatic data with a coarse spatial resolution (> 1 km²), derived from meteorological stations placed at 2
meters height in grasslands, are generally used as predictors in these species distribution models. However, variation in topography and vegetation cover gives rise to a substantial local offset from these macroclimatic data, sometimes even up to 20°C. In that regard, current models fail to portray real-life conditions as experienced by plant species living close to the ground surface (i.e. the microclimate) and therefore forsake to accurately predict the effects of climate change. To improve future research in this area, this project will develop a novel, high-resolution European microclimate map based on in-situ data from more than 1,600 sample locations. Thereafter, the effects of climate change on European plant species and the potential of the microclimate to mitigate species loss will be quantified. Ultimately, this project will fundamentally advance
ecological modeling and generate more insights on the impact of climate change on biodiversity. The output of this project will be of high relevance for policy makers and conservation managers in order to prioritize efforts and financial resources for biodiversity conservation.
